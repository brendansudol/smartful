      "Beginning in May 1968, a period of civil unrest occurred throughout France, lasting some seven weeks and punctuated by demonstrations, general strikes, and the occupation of universities and factories. At the height of events, which have since become known as May 68, the economy of France came to a halt. The protests reached such a point that political leaders feared civil war or revolution; the national government briefly ceased to function after President Charles de Gaulle secretly fled France to Germany at one point. The protests spurred movements worldwide, with songs, imaginative graffiti, posters, and slogans.",
      "The unrest began with a series of student occupation protests against capitalism, consumerism, American imperialism and traditional institutions. Heavy police repression of the protesters led France's trade union confederations to call for sympathy strikes, which spread far more quickly than expected to involve 11 million workers, more than 22% of the total population of France at the time."

      "Horace Greeley Hjalmar Schacht was a German economist, banker, centre-right politician, and co-founder in 1918 of the German Democratic Party. He served as the Currency Commissioner and President of the Reichsbank under the Weimar Republic. He was a fierce critic of his country's post-World War I reparation obligations.",
      "He served in Adolf Hitler's government as President of the National Bank 1933–1939 and became Minister of Economics.",
      "While Schacht was for a time feted for his role in the German \"economic miracle\", he opposed Hitler's policy of German re-armament insofar as it violated the Treaty of Versailles and disrupted the German economy. His views in this regard led Schacht to clash with Hitler and most notably with Hermann Göring. He was dismissed as President of the Reichsbank in January 1939. He remained as a minister without portfolio, and received the same salary, until he was fully dismissed from the government in January 1943.",
      "In 1944 Schacht was arrested by the Gestapo after the assassination attempt on Hitler on 20 July 1944, because he allegedly had contact with the assassins."

    "summary": "The Boeing 767 is a mid-size, wide-body twin-engine jet airliner built by Boeing Commercial Airplanes. It was the manufacturer's first wide-body twinjet and its first airliner with a two-crew glass cockpit. The aircraft features two turbofan engines, a conventional tail, and for reduced aerodynamic drag, a supercritical wing design. Designed as a smaller wide-body airliner than preceding aircraft such as the 747, the 767 has a capacity of 181 to 375 persons and a design range of 3,850 to 6,385 nautical miles (7,130 to 11,825 km), depending on variant. The original 767-200 entered service in 1982, followed by the 767-300 in 1986 and the 767-400ER, an extended-range variant, in 2000. Versions for freight and military use have also been created. The aircraft was initially flown on domestic and transcontinental routes, before becoming the first twin-engined airliner to receive regulatory approval for extended overseas flights. In 1986, Boeing initiated studies for a higher-capacity 767, ultimately leading to the development of the 777, a larger wide-body twinjet. In the 1990s, the 767 became the most frequently used airliner for transatlantic flights between North America and Europe.",

    "origin": "\"Regardless\" is rather simply derived from the noun \"regard\" (meaning \"attention\" or \"concern\") plus \"-less\" -- nothing too shocking about that. But poor \"regardless\" became embroiled in a usage scandal through no fault of its own when people began using \"irregardless\" as its synonym (probably blending \"irrespective\" and \"regardless\"). \"Irregardless\" originated in dialectal American speech in the early 20th century, and usage commentators have been decrying it since the 1920s, often declaring \"there is no such word.\" \"Irregardless\" does exist, of course, but it tends to be used primarily in speech and it is still considered nonstandard. \"Regardless\" is greatly preferred."
