      "The First Sino-Japanese War, also known as the Chino-Japanese War, was a conflict between the Qing dynasty of China and the Empire of Japan primarily over influence in Joseon Korea. After more than six months of unbroken successes by Japanese land and naval forces and the loss of the port of Weihaiwei, the Qing government sued for peace in February 1895.",
      "The war demonstrated the failure of the Qing dynasty's attempts to modernize its military and fend off threats to its sovereignty, especially when compared with Japan's successful Meiji Restoration. For the first time, regional dominance in East Asia shifted from China to Japan; the prestige of the Qing dynasty, along with the classical tradition in China, suffered a major blow. The humiliating loss of Korea as a tributary state sparked an unprecedented public outcry. Within China, the defeat was a catalyst for a series of political upheavals led by Sun Yat-sen and Kang Youwei, culminating in the 1911 Xinhai Revolution.",
      "The war is commonly known in China as the War of Jiawu, referring to the year as named under the traditional sexagenary system of years. In Japan, it is called the Japanâ€“Qing War."

Twice, in 1894 and 1914, he led \"Coxey's Army\", a group of unemployed men who marched to Washington, D.C., to present a \"Petition in Boots\" demanding that the United States Congress allocate funds to create jobs for the unemployed. Although the marches failed, Coxey's Army was an early attempt to arouse political interest in an issue that grew in importance until the Social Security Act of 1935 encouraged the establishment of state unemployment insurance programs."

    "summary": "The Sega 32X is an add-on for the Sega Genesis video game console. It was designed to expand the power of the Genesis and serve as a transitional console into the 32-bit era until the release of the Sega Saturn. Unveiled at June 1994's Consumer Electronics Show, Sega presented the 32X as a low-cost option for playing 32-bit games. Developed in response to the Atari Jaguar and concerns that the Saturn would not be ready by the end of 1994, the product was originally conceived as an entirely new console, but was converted into an add-on to the existing Genesis and made more powerful. To meet the release date of November 1994, development of the new system and its games were rushed. Ultimately, the console failed to attract third-party video game developers and sufficient consumers due to the announcement of the Sega Saturn's simultaneous release in Japan. By the end of 1994, the 32X had sold 665,000 units; it was discontinued in 1996. Initial reception was positive, highlighting the low price and power expansion to the Genesis, but later reviews were mostly negative because of its shallow game library, poor market timing and the resulting market fragmentation for the Genesis.",

    "origin": "\"Peculation\" has some peculiar relatives. It derives from Latin \"peculatus\" (\"misappropriation of property\"), which belongs to a family of Latin words having to do with property and possession. The most basic members of the family, \"pecu\" (\"cattle\") and \"pecus\"(\"livestock\"), reflect the fact that animals were a fundamental form of wealth in ancient societies. Other members of the family include \"pecunia\" (\"money\"), which gave English \"pecuniary\" (\"monetary\"), and \"peculiaris\" (\"of private property\" or \"special\"), which led to our \"peculiar.\""
