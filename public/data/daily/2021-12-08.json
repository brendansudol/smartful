It remained a major active theatre for two and a half years until the British Commonwealth Eighth Army crossed the border from Libya into Tunisia. In February 1943, command of the Eighth Army passed from Middle East Command to the Allied Joint command for the Mediterranean, Allied Forces Headquarters. Saudi Arabia, posturing as neutral though somewhat favoring the Allies, officially declared war on Germany and Japan in February 1945, though, in reality, the entire Middle East Theatre was quiet from 1943 until the end of the war."

The day after the establishment of a Jewish state in Eretz Israel, to be known as the State of Israel on 14 May 1948, neighboring Arab armies invaded the former British mandate and fought the Israeli forces. Later, the All-Palestine Government was established by the Arab League on 22 September 1948 to govern the Egyptian-controlled enclave in Gaza."

    "name": "Economy of the Iroquois",
    "summary": "The economy of the Iroquois originally focused on communal production and combined elements of both agricultural and hunter-gatherer systems. The Iroquois peoples were predominately agricultural, harvesting the Three Sisters commonly grown by American Indian groups: maize, beans, and squash. The Iroquois developed a system of economics very different from the now-dominant Western variety. This system consisted of several unique components including communal land ownership, division of labor by gender, and trade based on gift-giving. Contact with Europeans in the early 1600s had a profound impact on the economy of the Iroquois. At first they became important trading partners, but the expansion of European settlement upset the balance of the Iroquois economy. By 1800 the Iroquois had been confined to reservations, and they had to adapt their traditional economic system. In the 20th century, some of the Iroquois groups took advantage of their independent status on the reservation and started Indian casinos. Other Iroquois have incorporated themselves directly into the outside economies off of the reservation.",

    ],
    "origin": "It was probably British Navy personnel who first picked up \"cumshaw\" in Chinese ports, during the First Opium War of 1839. \"Cumshaw\" is from a word that means \"grateful thanks\" in the dialect of Xiamen, a port in southeast China. Apparently, sailors heard it from the beggars who hung around the ports, and mistook it as the word for a handout. Since then, U.S. sailors have given \"cumshaw\" its own unique application, for something obtained through unofficial means (whether deviously or simply ingeniously). Outside of naval circles, meanings of \"cumshaw\" range from a harmless gratuity or gift to bending the rules a little to outright bribery."
