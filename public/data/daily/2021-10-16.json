      "Zha Shibiao or Cha Shih-piao was a Chinese calligrapher and landscape painter from Anhui. He was affiliated with the Anhui School, also known as the Xin'an School, which is noted for dry brushstrokes and sparse compositions. His family, and himself, were art collectors and Ming dynasty aristocrats. He had studied for the civil service exam under the Ming and received the xiucai degree in his twenties. However he abandoned any attempt at an official career after the Manchu conquest. Subsequent to the 1670s he moved, or fled, depending on the source, to Yangzhou. As a calligrapher he was influenced by Dong Qichang and Mi Fu. His landscapes were more influenced by Hong Ren and Ni Zan. His later works are considered to have had a more moist and expressive feel than those of Hong Ren. As a person he was said to be easy-going, but slightly reclusive. He also had a fondness for drink, indulging into the late hours."

      "The Russo-Turkish wars were a series of twelve wars fought between the Russian Empire and the Ottoman Empire between the 17th and 20th centuries. It was one of the longest series of military conflicts in European history. Except for the war of 1710–11 and the Crimean War, which is often treated as a separate event, the conflicts ended disastrously for the stagnating Ottoman Empire; conversely they showcased the ascendancy of Russia as a European power after the modernisation efforts of Peter the Great in the early 18th century."

      "Ernest Bevin was a British statesman, trade union leader, and Labour politician. He co-founded and served as General Secretary of the powerful Transport and General Workers' Union in the years 1922–1940, and as Minister of Labour in the war-time coalition government. He succeeded in maximising the British labour supply, for both the armed services and domestic industrial production, with a minimum of strikes and disruption. His most important role came as Foreign Secretary in the post-war Labour government, 1945–1951. He gained American financial support, strongly opposed communism, and aided in the creation of NATO. Bevin's tenure also saw the end of the Mandate of Palestine and the creation of the State of Israel. His biographer, Alan Bullock, said that Bevin \"stands as the last of the line of foreign secretaries in the tradition created by Castlereagh, Canning and Palmerston in the first half of the 19th century\"."

    "name": "Me and Juliet",
    "summary": "Me and Juliet is a musical comedy by Richard Rodgers (music) and Oscar Hammerstein II (lyrics and book), their sixth stage collaboration. The work tells a story of romance backstage at a long-running musical: assistant stage manager Larry woos chorus girl Jeanie behind the back of her electrician boyfriend, Bob. Me and Juliet premiered in 1953 and was not a success, closing after a year on Broadway. The show received no Tony Award nominations. When Me and Juliet began tryout performances in Cleveland, the duo realized that the show had problems with the plot and staging. Extensive revisions during the remaining Cleveland and Boston tryouts failed to cure the difficulties with the plot, which the critics considered weak and uninteresting. The show was met with less-than-favorable reviews, though Jo Mielziner's staging won praise from audience and critics. The show closed once it had exhausted its advance sales. With the exception of a short run in Chicago, there was no national tour, and the show is almost never seen—a small-scale production was presented by London's Finborough Theatre in 2010.",

      "Uncle Ken is always armed with an argosy of jokes, and he keeps the family entertained for hours."

    "origin": "Looking at the first sense of \"argosy,\" you might assume that this word is a close relative of \"argonaut,\" but that isn't the case. Although both words have a nautical sense, they have different etymologies. The original argonauts sailed on a ship called the _Argo_ to seek the Golden Fleece; their moniker combines the name of their ship and the Greek word \"nautēs,\" meaning \"sailor.\" \"Argosy\" comes from \"Ragusa,\" the Italian name for the city that is now Dubrovnik, Croatia. Over time, \"Ragusa\" was modified into \"ragusea,\" a noun for the laden merchant ships that sailed from that port in medieval days. A broadening of meaning and another shift in spelling gave us \"argosy,\" denoting any merchant vessel or rich store."
