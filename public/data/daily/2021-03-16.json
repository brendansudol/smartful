      "Hans Holbein the Younger was a German painter and printmaker who worked in a Northern Renaissance style, and is considered one of the greatest portraitists of the 16th century. He also produced religious art, satire, and Reformation propaganda, and he made a significant contribution to the history of book design. He is called \"the Younger\" to distinguish him from his father Hans Holbein the Elder, an accomplished painter of the Late Gothic school.",
      "Holbein was born in Augsburg, but he worked mainly in Basel as a young artist. At first, he painted murals and religious works, designed stained glass windows, and printed books. He also painted an occasional portrait, making his international mark with portraits of humanist Desiderius Erasmus of Rotterdam. When the Reformation reached Basel, Holbein worked for reformist clients while continuing to serve traditional religious patrons. His Late Gothic style was enriched by artistic trends in Italy, France, and the Netherlands, as well as by Renaissance humanism. The result was a combined aesthetic uniquely his own.",
      "Holbein travelled to England in 1526 in search of work, with a recommendation from Erasmus."

Merit badges have been an integral part of the Scouting program since the start of the movement in the United Kingdom in 1908. Scouting came to the United States in 1910; the BSA quickly issued an initial list of just 14 merit badges, but did not produce or award them. In 1911, the BSA manufactured the first official 57 merit badges and began awarding them. The number of badges available has been as high as 140 and, as of 2006, is 121. Merit badge types are identifiable by the cloth and manufacturing process used to make them. The classification of badges into types came about as a way for collectors to categorize and classify their collections. Merit badge collectors often collect other Scouting memorabilia as well.",

    "origin": "The noun \"amalgam\" derives by way of Middle French from Medieval Latin \"amalgama.\" It was first used in the 15th century with the meaning \"a mixture of mercury and another metal.\" (Today, you are likely to encounter this sense in the field of dentistry; amalgams can be used for filling holes in teeth.) Over time, use of \"amalgam\" broadened to include any mixture of elements.and by the 18th century the word was also being applied figuratively, as in \"an amalgam of citizens.\" The verb \"amalgamate\" has been in use since at least 1617. It too can be used either technically, implying the creation of an alloy of mercury, or more generally for the formation of any compound or combined entity."
