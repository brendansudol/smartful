      "Jeffrey L. Koons is an American artist recognized for his work dealing with popular culture and his sculptures depicting everyday objects, including balloon animals – produced in stainless steel with mirror-finish surfaces. He lives and works in both New York City and his hometown of York, Pennsylvania. His works have sold for substantial sums, including at least two record auction prices for a work by a living artist, including $91.1 million with fees in May 2019, for his Rabbit, purchased by Robert E. Mnuchin according to a New York Times article.",
      "On November 12, 2013, Koons' Balloon Dog sold at Christie's Post-War and Contemporary Art Evening Sale in New York City for US$58.4 million, above its high US$55 million estimate, becoming the most expensive work by a living artist sold at auction. The price topped Koons' previous record of US$33.7 million and the record for the most expensive living artist, held by Gerhard Richter, whose 1968 painting, Domplatz, Mailand, sold for US$37.1 million at Sotheby's on May 14, 2013. Balloon Dog was one of the first of his Balloon Dog works to be fabricated, and had been acquired by Greenwich collector Peter Brant in the late 1990s."

Prior to joining the Supreme Court, Taney served as the United States Attorney General and United States Secretary of the Treasury under President Andrew Jackson.",
      "Taney was born into a wealthy, slave-owning family in Calvert County, Maryland. He won election to the Maryland House of Delegates as a member of the Federalist Party, but later broke with the party over the War of 1812. After switching to the Democratic Party, Taney was elected to the Maryland Senate in 1816. He emerged as one of the most prominent attorneys in the state and was appointed as the Attorney General of Maryland in 1827. Taney supported Andrew Jackson's presidential campaigns in 1824 and 1828, and he became a member of Jackson's Democratic Party. After a cabinet shake-up in 1831, President Jackson appointed Taney as his attorney general."

The song's musical style, and its production by Austin, was heavily inspired by music from the 1980s, and its lyrics chronicle a relationship in which two lovers have separated, but remain \"cool\" with each other and good friends. It received praise from critics, and parallels have been drawn by the media between the lyrical content of \"Cool\" and the real-life relationship Stefani had with Tony Kanal, a fellow group member of Stefani's in No Doubt. The song was released as the fourth single in the summer of 2005, and although it failed to match the chart success of its predecessor \"Hollaback Girl\", which reached number one in several countries, \"Cool\" is considered to be a worldwide hit as it reached number one in Canada, the top ten in Australia, and the top twenty in the United Kingdom and the United States, where it became Stefani's fifth top-twenty single.",

'Use it up, wear it out,' says the proverb of their creed (and not that of splendid and _orgulous_ Protestants), 'make it do, do without': and they possess themselves in edge-worn and threadbare truth.\" -From John Crowley's short story \"Novelty,\" from the 2009 collection _Novelties & Souvenirs_"

    "origin": "\"In Troy, there lies the scene. From Isles of Greece / The princes orgulous, their high blood chaf'd, / Have to the port of Athens sent their ships.\" Thus Shakespeare began the Trojan War tale Troilus and Cressida, employing \"orgulous,\" a colorful word first adopted in the 13th century from Anglo-French \"orguillus.\" After the Bard's day, \"orgulous\" dropped from sight for 200 years; there is no record of its use until it was rejuvenated by the pens of Robert Southey and Sir Walter Scott in the early 1800s. Twentieth-century authors (including James Joyce and W.H. Auden) continued its renaissance, and it remains an elegant (if infrequent) choice for today's writers."
