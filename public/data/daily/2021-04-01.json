    "origin": "\"Baroque\" came to English from a French word meaning \"irregularly shaped.\" At first, the word in French was used mostly to refer to pearls. Eventually, it came to describe an extravagant style of art characterized by curving lines, gilt, and gold. This type of art, which was prevalent especially in the 17th century, was sometimes considered to be excessively decorated and overly complicated. It makes sense, therefore, that the meaning of the word \"baroque\" has broadened to include anything that seems excessively ornate or elaborate."
